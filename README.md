# Dual Theme Website

This is a simple website created to fiddle with multiple colour themes. It has a dark (default) mode and a light mode.

It saves the user's preference on the local storage. In order to avoid a flash of the default theme on page load, it loads a short script before the website's body to retrieve the saved preference and update the `html` tag accordingly.
